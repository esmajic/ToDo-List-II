# ToDo-List-II (second task related to ToDo project in BildIT June 2019)

Reminder: code looks so ugly and that means that this is preliminary version...edition will arise soon...

- create Account
- log-in into Account(if it exists)
- create new To-Do (new task)

To-Do task must have:
- Time and date of creation
- task owner
- task description
- (I added tagging comment)

Application must allow:
- task description editing
- task removal/deletion
- listing of all existing tasks

Test coverage must be at least 50%.

BONUS:
- use of file(s) for data persistance
- listing of task as per date and time
- option that allows task tagging and listing all tagged tasks separately
